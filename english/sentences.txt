====== spring action ======

==== If you’re a seasoned Spring veteran, you’ll find that these new elements will become valuable additions to your Spring toolkit. ====

==== Have you ever stuck around long enough after a movie to watch the credits? ====

==== When it comes to expressing a bean wiring specification, Spring is incredibly flexible, offering three primary wiring mechanisms: ====
	
	== explicit configuration in XML ==
	== explicit configuration in Java ==
	== implicit bean discovery and automatic wiring ==

At first glance, it may seem that offering these three configuration options complicates Spring. There is some overlap in what each configuration technique offers, and it can be overwhelming to decide which technique is most applicable for a given situation. But don’t be distressed—in many cases, the choice is largely a matter of personal taste, and you’re welcome to choose the approach that feels best for you.

==== Fortunately, none of the configuration options available in Spring are mutually exclusive. ====

==== Spring has several other tricks up its sleeve for more advanced bean wiring. ====

==== That’s because every home has a meter that measures every kilowatt, and once a month someone comes by to read that meter so that the electric company knows how much to bill us. ====

==== Monitoring electricity consumption is an important function, but it isn’t foremost in most homeowners’ minds. Mowing the lawn, vacuuming the carpet, and cleaning the bathroom are the kinds of things that homeowners are actively involved in. ====

==== The term classic usually carries a good connotation. ====

==== Imagine for a moment that you’re stranded on a deserted island. This may sound like a dream come true. After all, who wouldn’t want some solitude on a beach, blissfully ignorant of the goings-on of the outside world? ====

==== There’s an old joke about a skydiver who’s blown off course and ends up landing in a tree, dangling above the ground. After a while, someone walks by, and the skydiver asks where he is. The passerby answers, “You’re about 20 feet off the ground.” The skydiver replies, “You must be a software analyst.” “You’re right. How did you know?” asks the passerby. “Because what you told me was 100% accurate but completely worthless.” ====


====== docker guides ======
The application itself is very simple so that you are not too distracted by what the code is doing. After all, the value of Docker is in how it can build, ship, and run applications; it’s totally agnostic as to what your application actually does.

Docker offers three different ways to mount data into a container from the Docker host: volumes, bind mounts, or tmpfs volumes. When in doubt, volumes are almost always the right choice.
